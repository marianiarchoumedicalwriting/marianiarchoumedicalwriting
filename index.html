            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a medical writer with a PhD in psychiatric genetics and over a decade of experience in academic research. I’ve authored more than 20 first-author peer-reviewed publications and contributed to another 20+ in high-impact journals including <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>, <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, and <em>Translational Psychiatry</em>. My work has been supported by prestigious funding, including a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship and an R03 from the National Institute on Al...
            <p>Over the years, I’ve presented at major international conferences, delivered oral presentations, and written blog posts and science communication pieces aimed at broader audiences. Since 2023, I also serve at an Institutional Review Board (IRB), where I review regulatory compliance for multiple studies each week.</p>
            <p>What I’ve always loved most about research is the writing—translating complex findings into clear, meaningful narratives. I’m passionate about delivering accurate, evidence-based content and making science more accessible through thoughtful communication.</p>
